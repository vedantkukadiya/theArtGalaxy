    ->      Are you in the process of creating an application portfolio for a foundation course, certificate, associate or
        undergraduate degree at art-related courses, such as Fine Arts, Architecture, Graphic Design, Illustration,
        Interior Design, Animation, and other creative, visual art-based courses?
       
        What should be in your portfolio? How do you present a portfolio? What gives you the best chance of being
        accepted by the art school of your dreams? Just as every art student is different (with individual strengths,
        experiences, passions, and ideas) every art school has different requirements and expectations. This variation
        in expectations can leave students uncertain about how to proceed. Even when the criteria is clear, applicants
        may feel overwhelmed and wonder what to create, which mediums to use, and how to best select and present their
        work. The Art Hub helps in guiding & developing the perfect portfolio as per the specific college requirements.
        
     WHAT IS A PORTFOLIO?
    ->    A portfolio is a collection of your best art and design work. However, at The Art Hub, we think a portfolio is
        MUCH more. Your portfolio integrates all aspects of your candidacy into tangible evidence of how you prepared
        for your academic mission. Your portfolio connects the dots of where you’ve been, who you are now, and who you
        aspire to be. In other words, it shows your journey. To assess your potential to be a successful student, art
        and design programs expect you to have a mandatory portfolio upon application. In highly selective BFA or MFA
        programs, it can be the main factor in admission decisions. our portfolio serves as a guide that documents and
        communicates your artistic development. Working with you to build your best portfolio is one of the things we do
        best. In conclusion, we will help you effectively communicate who YOU are to colleges & beyond.
