                two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and
                textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat
                surface.</p>

                <p>Singing is the act of creating musical sounds with the voice. A person whose profession is
                    singing is called a singer, artist or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music). Singers perform
                    music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical

                <p>Shooting at a mark as a test of skill began with archery, long before the advent of firearms (c.
                    1300). Firearms were first used in warfare and later in sport shooting (hunting), and because of the
                    shadowy early history of firearms, it is not known when target shooting began.</p>

                <p>There are many forms of kung fu, such as Shaolin kung fu, Wing Chun, and tai chi, and they are
                    practiced all over the world. Each form of kung fu has its own principles and techniques, but is
                    best known for its trickery and quickness. It is only in the late twentieth century that this term
                    was used in relation to Chinese martial arts by the Chinese community.
